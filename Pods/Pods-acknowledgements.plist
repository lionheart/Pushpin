offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or
other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where
such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor
that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination
of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory
patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License
for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof
in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form,
provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
this License; and
You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You
changed the files; and
You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute,
all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form
of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
Derivative Works; and
If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any
Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the
following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along
with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of
the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that
You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
modifying the License.
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted
for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of
any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding
such Contributions.

6. Trademarks.

This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the
Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied,
including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are
solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of
permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability.

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or
out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to
damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to
offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or
other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your
sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

&lt;h3&gt;3. Time Zone Database&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from &lt;a href="http://www.iana.org/time-zones"&gt;
Time Zone Database&lt;/a&gt; for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database is explained
in &lt;a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6557"&gt;BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
Database&lt;/a&gt; section 7.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
7.  Database Ownership

   The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
   document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
   that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the public
   domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do not apply
   to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make to it.
   Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ Database,
   the organization that is providing the IANA Considerations defined in
   this RFC, under the memorandum of understanding with the IETF,
   currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all competent court
   orders.  No ownership claims will be made by ICANN or the IETF Trust
   on the database or the code.  Any person making a contribution to the
   database or code waives all rights to future claims in that
   contribution or in the TZ Database.

&lt;/pre&gt;

UserVoice for iOS allows you to embed UserVoice directly in your iPhone or iPad app, allowing you to provide Instant Answers to your customers’ questions, a searchable knowledge base, and feedback forum. Our contact form is a friendlier experience than an email composer filled with debug information, and also eliminates those blank requests clogging up your inbox.

To get started, you will need to have a free UserVoice account to connect to. Go to [uservoice.com/mobile/](https://uservoice.com/mobile/) to sign up for free.

Binary builds of the SDK are available for download:
* Current release: [3.0.2](https://github.com/uservoice/uservoice-ios-sdk/releases/tag/3.0.2) (updated 2014-01-16)
* See [Releases](https://github.com/uservoice/uservoice-ios-sdk/releases) for release notes and previous versions

We also have an [example app](https://github.com/uservoice/uservoice-iphone-example) on GitHub that demonstrates how to build and integrate the SDK.

## Upgrading from 2.0.x

* You should pass your `UVConfig` to `+[UserVoice initialize:]` shortly after app launch so that we can provide you with accurate usage reports.
* If you are using a custom stylesheet, you will need to update your code as both the set of options and the method of setting them have changed. See the section below on Customizing Colors.
* You no longer need to pass a client key pair to UVConfig unless you have restricted access enabled on your UserVoice site.
* We are dropping support for versions of iOS prior to 6.0.

## Installation

* Download the latest build.
* Drag `UVHeaders`, `UVResources`, and `libUserVoice.a` into your project.
  * When adding the folders, make sure you have "Create groups for any added folders" selected rather than "Create folder references for any added folders".
* Note that the `.h` files in  `UVHeaders` do not need to be added to your target.
* Add QuartzCore and SystemConfiguration frameworks to your project.

See [DEV.md](https://github.com/uservoice/uservoice-iphone-sdk/blob/master/DEV.md) if you want to build the SDK yourself.

## CocoaPods

Alternatively, if you are using CocoaPods just add the following to your Podfile.

    pod 'uservoice-iphone-sdk', '~&gt; 3.0'


## API


Once you have completed these steps, you are ready to launch the UserVoice UI from your code. Import `UserVoice.h` and create a `UVConfig` using one of the following options.

### Configuration

Start by creating a `UVConfig` object like this:

    UVConfig *config = [UVConfig configWithSite:@"yoursite.uservoice.com"];

Once you've set up your config the way you want it, you should go ahead and pass it to initialize:

    [UserVoice initialize:config];

This should be called when your app starts up so that we can provide accurate metrics in your UserVoice admin console.

### User identification

If you know who your user is, you can pass in their identity so that they won't
have to enter their name or email to send tickets or post ideas.

    [config identifyUserWithEmail:@"user@example.com" name:@"Example User" guid:@"123"];

GUID can be the same as email, but if you have an internal user id, you can
pass that so that the user's account will have continuity if they later change
their email address.

Note: One limitation is that this will not work if the email address matches an
admin on your UserVoice account (for security reasons). Admins will still be able
to use the iOS SDK but they will need to sign in the first time they do. If you are
testing this feature, make sure you are not testing with an admin account.

### Specify a forum

You can specify which forum users will interact with by id.  If you do not
specify a forum, it will use the default forum for your account.

    config.forumId = 123;

### Specify a help topic

You can also specify a help topic by id. If you don't then it will display a
list of all topics in your account, as long as they contain at least one
article.

    config.topicId = 123;

### Custom Fields

You can set custom field values on the `UVConfig` object. These will be used
associated with any tickets the user creates during their session. You can
also use this to set default values for custom fields on the contact form.

Note: You must first configure these fields in the UserVoice admin console.
If you pass fields that are not recognized by the server, they will be ignored.

    config.customFields = @{@"Key" : @"Value"};

### Toggle features

You can turn off certain features of the SDK if you do not want to use them. By
default, all features are enabled if they are available on your account.

**1. Turn off browsing the forum.** The user will still be able to post ideas, and view ideas that they find by searching.

    config.showForum = NO;

**2. Turn off posting ideas.** The user will still be able to browse and search existing ideas.

    config.showPostIdea = NO;

**3. Turn off the contact form.**

    config.showContactUs = NO;

**4. Turn of the knowledge base.** This only affects the knowledge base browser on the portal screen. Instant answers will still include articles.

    config.showKnowledgeBase = NO;

If you deep-link to an area that is turned off (such as the contact form), it
will still work. Turning off the feature only prevents it from being accessible
anywhere in the UserVoice UI.

### Invocation (Deep Linking)

There are 4 options for how to launch UserVoice from within your app:

**1. Standard UserVoice Interface:** This launches the UserVoice for iOS portal page where the user can browse suggestions, contact you or browse the knowledgebase. This is the full experience of everything the SDK can do.
    
    [UserVoice presentUserVoiceInterfaceForParentViewController:self];

**2. Direct link to contact form:** Launches user directly into the contact form, with Instant Answers, experience. Useful to link to from error or setup pages in your app.

    [UserVoice presentUserVoiceContactUsFormForParentViewController:self];
    
**3. Direct link to feedback forum:** Launches the user directly into the feedback forum where they can browse, vote on or give their own feedback. Useful for linking from a "Give us your ideas?" prompt from within your app.

    [UserVoice presentUserVoiceForumForParentViewController:self];

**4. Direct link to idea form:** Launches user directly into the idea form, with Instant Answers, experience.

    [UserVoice presentUserVoiceNewIdeaFormForParentViewController:self];


### Passing user traits

You can optionally pass further information about your users into UserVoice. This
will allow us to provide you more useful reports about your users.

    config.userTraits = @{
      @"created_at" : @(1364406966),    // Unix timestamp for the date the user signed up
      @"type" : @"Owner",               // Optional: segment your users by type
      @"account" : @{
        @"id" : @(123),                 // Optional: associate multiple users with a single account
        @"name" : @"Acme, Co.",         // Account name
        @"created_at" : @(1364406966),  // Unix timestampe for the date the account was created
        @"monthly_rate" : @(9.99),      // Decimal; monthly rate of the account
        @"ltv" : @(1495.00),            // Decimal; lifetime value of the account
        @"plan" : @"Enhanced"           // Plan name for the account
      }
    };

### Customizing Colors

You can also customize the appearance of the UserVoice user interface by
setting certain key colors.

```
#import "UVStyleSheet.h"
[UVStyleSheet instance].tintColor = [UIColor redColor];
[UVStyleSheet instance].tableViewBackgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor];
```

See `UVStyleSheet.h` for a complete list of the visual properties you can modify.

### User Language

The library will detect and display in the language the device is set to provided that language is supported by the SDK ([see currently supported languages](https://github.com/uservoice/uservoice-iphone-sdk#translations).).

### Private Sites

The SDK relies on being able to obtain a client key to communicate with the UserVoice API. If you have a public UserVoice site (the default) then it can obtain this key automatically, so you only need to pass your site URL. However, if you turn on site privacy, this key is also private, so you will need to pass it in. You can obtain a client key pair from the mobile settings section of the UserVoice admin console.

```
UVConfig *config = [UVConfig configWithSite:@"yoursite.uservoice.com" andKey:@"CLIENT_KEY" andSecret:@"CLIENT_SECRET"];
[UserVoice initialize:config];
```

FAQs
--------

**What if I only want to collect feedback? What if I only want a contact form?**
Don’t worry. UserVoice is a modular system and you can link to only the parts of the SDK you want to use. Check out how you can configure [invocation](https://github.com/uservoice/uservoice-iphone-sdk#invocation).

**Why would I use this over a Mail link?**
There are a lot of reasons why UserVoice for iOS is superior to a Mail link:

* It doesn’t take your users out of your app.
* It’s a more efficient way to scale customer support and engagement:
  * UserVoice automatically suggests articles and forum posts that help solve users’ issues before they contact you. We call it Instant Answers and it can reduce your support load by up to 40%.
  * We've shown it can reduce junk emails (people clicking send to get out of the email app) by up to 74%.
  * You can setup custom fields to ask custom questions and pass in environment information (account IDs) that help your agents answer questions faster, reducing the back and forth between agents and customers.
* By having a dedicated space for users to give feedback and vote up other users’ ideas, not only will you get more feedback (and more prioritized feedback), but you’ll also reduce the number of feature requests that end up in your support queue.

**What if I have a web app as well?**
No problemo! Every UserVoice account comes with a yourname.uservoice.com site and web widgets so you can administer both your mobile and web users from your UserVoice admin console.

**What about users who still send in email for support?**
UserVoice can handle that as well. Simply setup your existing support email forward to your UserVoice tickets email address (tickets@yourdomain.uservoice.com).

**Does it pass device ids or anything that would get me in trouble with Apple?**
Nope. UserVoice for iOS follows all of Apple’s policies to make sure you can confidently include our SDK in your app.

**Can I customize the look and feel to match my app?**
Yes. You can customize the colors of the UserVoice modal dialogs by creating your own stylesheet. Check out the [customization ] (https://github.com/uservoice/uservoice-iphone-sdk#customizing-colors) for more info.

If you have any other questions please contact support@uservoice.com.

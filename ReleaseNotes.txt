In company news, as a part of my move from California to Texas, Aurora Software is now Lionheart Software. Yay change!

Alright. I'm actually sort of amazed you've made it this far. As a reward, here's a speedily-written haiku.

Pushpin's here, refreshed
Syncing, searching, built for speed
It's love at first sight

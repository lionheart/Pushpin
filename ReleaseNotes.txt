Hi all. It's been a while. Pushpin has gotten a huge makeover. It's essentially a brand new app, rebuilt from the ground up to be fast, stable, and full of awesome features.

Here are the details:

* Pizzazzified user interface.
* Pull-to-refresh.
* Use popular mobilizers (Readability, Instapaper) in the in-app browser.
* View webpages in full screen by tapping the "puck" in the bottom right. Tap and drag the puck to move it around if it's in the way of something.
* Hide bookmark descriptions and tags by pinching two fingers towards each other on any view bookmark screen. Show them by pinching out. This is also configurable in display settings.
* Filter by multiple tags. Just keep tapping them.
* Add multiple-line descriptions for new and existing bookmarks.
* View feeds for users, tags, or a combination of the two. You can add saved feeds by navigating directly to "Saved Feeds", or by tapping the "Add" button when viewing a feed through the popular and network sections.
* URL scheme support for viewing feeds ("pushpin://feed?user=ticci&tags=pythonista,python")
* URL scheme support for viewing URLs using the Pushpin browser ("pushpin://morrick.me/")
* Delete multiple bookmarks at the same time by tapping the "Edit" button when viewing bookmarks.
* 1Password support.
* Show whether suggested tags are popular or recommended when adding and editing bookmarks.
* Order autocompleted tags by most frequently used, as opposed to alphabetically.
* Edit or add bookmarks when using the in-app browser.
* Make tappable tag area much larger.
* Hide tag sections that don't have any tags associated with them.

Alright. I'm actually sort of amazed you've made it this far. As a reward, here's a speedily-written haiku.

Pushpin's here, refreshed
Syncing, searching, built for speed
It's love at first sight
